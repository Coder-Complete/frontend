      - to do:
        - x - replace nav with hamburger menu
        - x - make tech stack imgs wrap
    - x - max-width
      - x - to do: make everything less wide
    - x - other flex properties (flex-grow, etc)
  - animations
    - x - tech stack items (on hover, lower opacity and transform scale 0.9)
    - x - image of myself (transform scale 0 -> 1.1 -> 1, delay 1s, backwards)
    - x - items slide up initially (fade up - opacity 0, transform translateY(40px) -> opacity 1, transform translateY(0), delay, backwards)
    - x - wave (transofrm rotate(0) -> transform rotate(30deg) -> rotate(0), infinite)
      - x - can't rotate inline els, has to be inline-block
    - x - links (:after content, w/ height and background color and position absolute, 0 -> 100% width transition ease)

    - x - projects (:before, cover w/ black & opacity & higher z-index, img scales to 1.07, text and links are elements, they go from 0 to 1 opacity, they also slide up from transformY(100%) to transformY(50%))
      - x - i'd probably rather make separate el for all this and position it on top of project w/ opacity 0 initially (rather than using :before)

    - x - "go to top" pops out to right of my name in footer (transfrom translateX(60px), )

  - other small changes
    - x - add circle photo of myself above "hi..."
    - x - contact button has background color
    - x - footer jared weiss takes back to top
    - x - hover for links under intro (change color?)
    - x - maybe put github, etc links in footer instead of # links, b/c can go to top w/ my name
    - x - suggest that if they want, they can design a cool logo for themselves and put instead of name
